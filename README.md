# Data driven platform for feedback collection analysis

This project is developed as part of my capstone project in fulfillment of the **Diploma in Data Science** at **TelOne Center for Learning**. The Feedback Collection & Analysis App is designed to collect feedback from users, perform sentiment analysis, and generate insightful reports using advanced techniques like clustering and Large Language Models (LLMs).

The app is accessible at: [this link](https://data-driven-platform-for-feedback-collection-analysis.streamlit.app)

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to build an intuitive system that allows organizations to:
- Collect user feedback efficiently.
- Analyze the sentiment of the feedback to determine user satisfaction.
- Cluster similar feedback to discover common themes or issues.
- Automatically generate detailed reports to provide actionable insights.

## Key Features
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Classifies feedback as positive, neutral, or negative using natural language processing (NLP).
- **Clustering**: Groups feedback entries with similar themes for easy identification of trends.
- **Automated Reports**: Generates customized feedback reports, including visualizations and summaries of key insights.
- **LLM Integration**: Utilizes Large Language Models to analyze feedback text for more accurate and meaningful results.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core language for development.
- **Streamlit**: For building the user interface.
- **scikit-learn**: For clustering algorithms.
- **Transformers (Hugging Face)**: For integrating LLMs and performing sentiment analysis.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For generating visualizations.
## How to Access the Admin Section

The app includes an admin section for managing feedback and reviewing reports. To access the admin section, use the following credentials:

- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `admin`

Once logged in, the admin can:
- View all collected feedback.
- Generate detailed reports based on the latest feedback.
- Analyze feedback clusters, visualizations and sentiment trends.
  
## Future Work
- **Additional NLP Features**: Explore topic modeling to extract more insights from user feedback.
- **Enhanced Visualizations**: Add more interactive visualizations to provide a deeper understanding of feedback trends.
- **Deployment**: Continue to enhance the app for better scalability and security.
